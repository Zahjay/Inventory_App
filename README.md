# Business Beta | Zahra Abd'Allah

This is my second project for General Assembly. For this project I am building a CRUD app called Business Beta. In a nutshell, it is a beta site that I am creating to help with organization of my family business.

# Wireframes 

Wireframes for this project are located in the assests directory.

# Overview

I want to build an app for my family business. That will help to keep up with store inventory in a clear, concise way.  This project is a starting place and first step in making the vision of a functional website a reality. 


# Functionality Goals 
To make a Functional CRUD App.
It should be able to add product info
Delete product info
Update product info 
Read product info


# Initial Thoughts
When I first came to GA a phrase that was repeated was,“start with the end in mind.” This is the app that is leading toward the end result. I’m not exactly sure how to get the vision I see in my head to an application, so it will be a fun challenge to do so.
 
Express and I have not been the best of friend so with this project I hope to gain a better understanding of how it works. Eventually I would like to expand the inventory with our company as it grows. 

# Phases of Completetion
 1.) Setting up File Structure 2.) Connecting Routes 3.)Debugging 4.)Styling 5.)Deployment to herokuapp.

 # Links and Resources

 The biggest resource that I used for this project was the final quotes app model. It extremely helped to be able to visually see what I was suppose do step by step. For this project I utilized my peers, the TA's, as well as my group leaders for this Unit.
